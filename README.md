# Personality Big Five IPIP100

This project is a single page application written in Vue that assesses personality under the big-five OCEAN. Tests items were drawn from the International Personality Item Pool 100. 

At the moment, all items are only available in Brazilian Portuguese. If you're interested in translating into your language, drop me a message.
